# About
I wasn't satisfied with the available options for mass deleting my iMessages. It was slow and clunky, so I decided to create a programmatic way of accomplishing what I needed. I'm certain there is a pure bash way of doing this, but I didn't know enough about bash and how/if it could handle asynchronous code very well, so I decided to use a combination of Node.js' spawn method and bash.`

## Directory Structure
I decided to structure everything per this [gist](https://gist.github.com/tracker1/59f2c13044315f88bee9).
